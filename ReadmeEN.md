## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

<h6>
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
</h6>

<p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</p>
<p><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</p>
<p><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</p>
<p><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p>
</p>

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

###### Follow these principles:

<ol>
<li>
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.
</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
</li>
<li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol>
